Modifications to the 'GeckoUSB' driver for the Nintendo Gamecube originally by Ian Callaghan - usbgecko.com.

This code targets a Xilinx Spartan3, on the Xilinx demo board.

Also included is a patch to the kernel, against 2.6.32.27, from the 'mikep1' kernel. This patch increases performance significantly and increases stability. See http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29309168 for more information on it.
